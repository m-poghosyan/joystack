# Joystack Frontend
React based frontend.

## Building locally
We are using a private npm-registry for some dependencies (like api clients).
In order to get those dependencies, the registry api-key has to be configured
in an environment variable, named: `NPM_REGISTRY_AUTH`.

## Running locally
In order to run the app locally execute:
`npm start`
